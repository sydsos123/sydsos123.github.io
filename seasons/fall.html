                <h2>Fall (or Autmun if you're in a different tax-bracket) </h2>

                <p> <img src="autumn.jpeg" alt="Autumn" class="autumn"> Fall, also referred to as Autumn is arguably one the best seasons. It has the perfect temperature and is filled with wonderful colors. It also has the best smell. Between the crisp air and the earthy smell from the leaves, it's hard to find a surperior seasons. </p>
                <p> People often say that Summer is the best season; and to that I say: get lost. Have you ever been outside in Fall?? Its GORGEOUS and you dont have to sweat your butt off. There is virutally no chaffing, no sweaty pits, no suffering from the heat that feels like it is trying to melt your skin off. Don't get me wrong, there are many benefits to the summer; but are they as good as fall? No. Get real. </p>
