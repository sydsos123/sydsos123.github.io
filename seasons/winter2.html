            <p> Winter is the second-best season. I know what you're thinking: first is the worst, and second is the best, so obviously, Winter trumps fall. That can't be more true. As we've discussed, Fall is genuinely the best season due to its perfect temperature and amazing colors. Winter gets second place because of Harry Potter and the colors. Harry in Winter, the theme by Patrick Doyle, epitomizes nostalgia for me. It represents Harry in Winter during the film adaptation of the Goblet of Fire. It is the perfect Christmas piece for me and makes me miss Winter every time I listen to it. The Winter scenes in the Harry Potter movies are so iconic for me. They're so well done; they make me miss Winter every time. </p>
                <p> Additionally, there's a theory that the Vikings and the Nords were known to be so beautiful because of their cold environments. The temperature might be unbearable at the time, but it can slow down the skin's aging process. Being from Minnesota, where pretty much everyone jokes about being a Viking or Nordic, who would I be not even to acknowledge it? Also, since I'm from Minnesota, Winter has to be up there for me. </p>

        <footer> Winter wins second place because Harry Potter and Hogwarts in Winter is simply elite. 10/10. It still can't replace fall, though. </footer>
