                <p> <img src="spring.jpeg" alt="Boat" class="boat"> Spring is a magical season. I should be saying that about Fall because of Halloween and all, but Spring signifies much more. It's about life coming back, and that, for me, is about fairies. That sounds kind of dumb, but I grew up on Tinker Bell. I had an entire Tinker Bell-themed room. From my bed sheets to my rug, my wall art, and the color on my walls. I was OBSESSED, which is why I get a magical feeling from Spring. If you've never seen Tinker Bell, it's about how faries change the season. In the first Tinker Bell movie (one of my all-time favs at the time), they changed the season from Winter to Spring. It was so magical and vibrant; it made a huge impact on me for some reason. </p>
            <p> As I got older, Spring was still magical for me, but there were many downfalls. I developed allergies and realized that Spring always happens right when you're tired of the cold. The first half of Spring is always freezing, even more so than Winter. The second half of Spring, is the part I like. It's warmer, the flowers are coming out, the animals are coming back, and it smells fantastic. This is also a sweet spot where it is warm but still cold enough where bugs aren't out yet. Overall, it's a great and magical season, but there are too many downfalls. </p>

        <footer> Spring is one of the best seasons, but it only places 3rd because sometimes it gets too cold, and the allergies are flaring. </footer>
