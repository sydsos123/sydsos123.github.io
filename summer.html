            <p>Summer comes last for me because it is too hot. Don't get me wrong, I love hanging out with friends and going to the drive-in movie theater, but I can't stand the heat. Especially in Minnesota, the heat is always humid, and you feel like you can't breathe. Also, because of all of our lakes, we have SWARMS of mosquitos. When I first came to Montana, I was talking about how we shouldn't walk outside at night because of the bugs. I kept getting weird looks, but I brushed it all. As it turns out, Montana (maybe Helena specifically) has like ZERO night-time bugs, including mosquitos. Summer night here is lovely, but in Minnesota, everyone hides inside. </p>

        <footer> Summer comes in last place because it is too hot, too humid, and too sticky. I love the drive-in, though! </footer>
