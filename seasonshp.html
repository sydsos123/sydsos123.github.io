                <h2>About Us: The Cause </h2>

                <p> <img src="four.jpeg" alt="Four" class="four">  Are you tired of only experiencing mild and extreme-ish weather that can't qualify for any season? Me too! This page is dedicated to experiencing all four seasons at the proper times. I don't want to experience winter in the summer and vice-versa. It is literally November right now, and we have 60-degree weather. WHERE IS THE SNOW????? WHERE IS IT???? This is not righteous, and we must band together to end it. Please enjoy this website and consider our cause. </p>
