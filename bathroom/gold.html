                <h2>The Gold Bar - 6/10 </h2>
                <p> It's not my first choice by any means. The Gold Bar used to have a higher rating; however, with the closure of one of their stalls, they're reduced to one. This stall is just okay. It is very small, and there is not enough room for multiple people to fit in. Outside of the stall, there is plenty of space, which is often filled with people waiting to use the bathroom. There is only one sink and one paper towel dispenser. This can create a big issue for how busy the gold bar gets. The bathroom gets cluttered and messy quickly.</p>
                <br>
                
               <p> There is also a lingering weird stench, but honestly, I'm not one to judge The Gold Bar. That's the classy side with Old Salt. Overall, it's not a bad bathroom, but they can do better. I don't know of anyone who has disgraced this bathroom. That's normally saved for the Western. Bonus points for that. 6/10.</p>
