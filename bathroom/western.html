                <h2> The Western - 4/10</h2>
                <p> Man, if I could give The Western nostoliga points, I would. Talk about a bonding experience. It's small enough to bring in one other person, but it's the perfect size for a quick debrief while you're both peeing. Objectively, however, this bathroom is just awful. It has one toilet that's always messed up in some type of way. The bathroom is literally always wet and covered with paper towels. There isn't much to write about this bathroom since it is a shoebox. </p>
                <br>
                
               <p> I ultimately have very fond memories of this bathroom, but since it is my job to rate these bathrooms objectively, I must give it a 4/10. It's not a classy bathroom, but damn, is it a bathroom. The only thing keeping it from a 3/10 is that it locks and two people can fit in there. 4/10.</p>
