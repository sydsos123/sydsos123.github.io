                <h2>The Hawthorn - 7/10</h2>
                <p> The Hawthorn is always a nice bathroom to visit. Known as a "classy" establishment around town, the Hathorn's is a fantastic wine bar that serves Helena's finest. And their bathroom certainly looks like it, too. The bathroom, even during the Montana summers, always somehow remains cold. This is a nice feature, as I cannot think of anything worse than dying in a hot bathroom while begging God to let it all stop. Additionally, they have two sinks (bonus), automatic towel dispensers (double bonus), and a large mirror. The bathroom has a handicap stall and a stall for bracing. The toilet is always clean, but I still would not trust touching the handle with my bare hand. As for toilet paper, they're always stocked up. This is saying more than most bathrooms around Helena, as we have all certainly been in a position where there is absolutely zero toilet paper anywhere. The cons are the lightning. The Hawthorn's bathroom definitely has humbling lighting that will make you question if you actually know how to put on makeup or if you really just look that way. On top of that, due to the low number of stalls, a line can form, and the bathroom can get messy.</p>

               <p> Overall, this bathroom is nice, cool, and comfortable. It serves its purpose while keeping you in a nice area. While the Hawthorn is known for its class, their bathroom represents that to a certain extent. It would not be my first choice to destroy as I would feel bad for the innocence of the bathroom, but then again, I know people who have projectile vomited in this bathroom. And yet, it still looks pristine. 7/10.</p>
