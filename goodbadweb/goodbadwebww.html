    <h3> <a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/"> WizardingWorld</a></h3>
<p> The WizardingWorld website is one that I have been impressed with since I was a kid. As a massive Harry Potter fan (former president of Harry Potter Club. Not trying to brag or anything, but I was re-elected four times, so…), I am very familiar with the WizardingWorld website, from its conception of Pottermore to two horrific global events (COVID-19 and the renaming of Pottermore to WizardingWorld). Even though the name is not my favorite (I do not like change), the website has continued to improve. It is a very sophisticated website, from its numerous sub-web pages to smaller things like the stars in the background of the website. </p>
    <p> This website is highly creative and detail-oriented. The stars and glimmers in the background give it a magical element, which continues throughout the entire page. The home page opens to a slow reveal of 'Harry Potter' and "Fantastic Beasts" and has a merch grab. The merch grab is typically seasonal or draws on current events; since Christmas is right around the corner, the recent merch grab is Christmas-themed. It has a purple 'EXPLORE' button that matches the navy blue background. Once you click on it, you are exported to another webpage for a Harry Potter Christmas Gift Guide. Back on the main page, the Christmas-themed merch grab cuts off half of the picture once put into mobile. I️ suspect this is because the full picture would be awkward on mobile since it is so long. It looks good, and you wouldn't give it a second thought if you were mobile first; however, I like the layout of the web screen with the whole picture better. There is also a diamond icon motioning you to scroll down the page. I think this gives the website a simple yet magical vibe, which is the goal of this website. </p>
    <p> Once scrolling down, you see a line of new publications from "Feature", "News", and "Quizzes". These are for quick access and are meant to grab the attention of the user of the website to go down a rabbit hole (which I do not think is a bad thing for Harry Potter). Continuing to scroll down, you get the same thing, from trivia to exclusive items, the latest news, and articles. Finally, you get to the bottom, where you can find their social media and other standard web page links (About Us, Press, FAQs, etc). One aspect of this website I really like is that the top of the website with the menu, WizardingWorld logo, and the 'Sign Up' button does not disappear, even when you are scrolling down. It also works in full screen and mobile without taking up too much of the screen. I like this because I can sign up or choose web pages from the menu at any time. The menu bar is also helpful. It has a search bar and quick links to common web pages, like the sorting hat quiz. I also like the WizardingWorld website because it barely lags. It's a fast and put-together website. </p>
           <p>Scrolling through the code is overwhelming, but it appears clean and consistent. As far as I can tell, they used many columns. There was a column for Quizzes, News, and Features. These columns also had columns used to display all the articles, news, and quizzes displayed throughout the website. One thing I don't like about this website is how many articles, quizzes, and news they have listed. Part of the website should have been dedicated to each section instead of looping them all in together. It's a little hard to navigate or find an article/quiz/news you want to read. Overall, this is a great website that is well-established and clean. </p>
