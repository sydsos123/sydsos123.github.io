        <h3> <a href="https://www.nps.gov/voya/index.htm"> Voyageurs National Park </a> </h3>
    <p> One website I like is the Voyageurs National Park website under the National Park Service Website. This website is clean and clear-cut. It has beautiful photos of the scenery and quick facts about the park. They use basic colors, such as black, white, and light green. The colors do not necessarily match the photos, but it is still complimentary. If they wanted to spice it up, they should make the website’s colors to match Voyageurs (typically green and grey) or match it to the NPS logo (brown and green). </p>

        <p>Additionally, it has many other quick links to important information about planning visits, directions, and accessibility. When opening the website, current alerts pop up; you can dismiss or ignore them and continue scrolling through the website. I like this aspect as it’s not jarring and annoying like a pop-up alert box, but you can continue viewing the website or dismiss it. You can easily find the alerts again by clicking on the alerts tab. Here, it is easily categorized by ‘Park Closure’, ‘Caution’, and ‘Information’. It also has an information tab, where basic information, such as the address, directions, seasons, visitor centers, passes, and weather, can be found. This is an excellent aspect as you do not have to spend a lot of time scrolling through pages to find important information. </p>
            <p> The website also has a maps tab, filled with multiple maps marked with different areas of the park. This is useful if you want Day Site locations or Camping locations; however, this feature is hard to scroll on as you can accidentally get stuck zooming in or out on a map instead of scrolling on the actual website. The calendar tab displays available programs, events, and starter parties. The Fees tab is important as it gives any patron important information about the cost of entrance and the passes one might need to stay in the park. This tab also explains how fees are necessary to benefit the park and links and in-depth articles explaining the benefits. The menu tab in the upper right-hand corner also has quick links to more important information, like planning a visit, volunteer work, and learning. This menu tab is divided into two sections, ‘Explore this Park’ and ‘Explore the National Park Service’. The search bar has a filter to only search in the Voyageurs Site or all National Parks. </p>
               <p> At the bottom of the page, they have another search bar and advertising for the NPS app. They also have their mailing address, social media, and legal links. The mobile version is put together better than the computer version. It’s more cohesive, and the colors work together a bit better. The mobile version also had more pictures. Voyageurs had numerous small aspects that made it stand out. From the mobile version to the filtered search bar, I liked that their goal was to make the website clear and easy to navigate. The font was easy to read and was an appropriate size to read. While I liked all the information they had, the pages also tended to be longer, and there was a lot of scrolling involved. 
                   <p> In terms of columns, they did use a lot of columns, but it took me a long time to find them within the code. Most of the columns they used were for pictures and the contact info at the bottom of the website. They use columns for the main body of the website to include pictures; however, I find that it works very well for them. It’s well-spaced and looks put-together and convenient. They included pictures with titles and short descriptions. They also used columns to display the four square images at the bottom of their website. Overall, I think this is a good website that is well put together. I like that it is simple yet very complicated in terms of code. While I do not understand all of the code, it seemed well put together from what I can understand. </p>
