    <p> Arngren is a Norwegian website used to sell gadgets and appliances; however, it is a horrific website that I personally think would make Professor Wald shiver if he has not seen it already. Arngren looks like a website I would produce if I tried to make a website without any notes one year from now. It's borderline impressive. It appears to have sophisticated and complex elements, yet is utterly… trash. The only way this website makes sense is if it was purposely made to be a joke. I just do not understand how this website came to be. It is so wildly cluttered it will give you a headache trying to decipher it.  </p>
        <p>It has many pictures uploaded, along with prices. Clicking the prices will route you to either a completely (and better-looking) website, or you'll go to an Arngren web page. The web pages have more pictures and ads of the item they're trying to sell. It's a bit more spaced out but still cluttered. There is almost endless scrolling both down and to the side on these web pages as well. Back on the homepage, the menu is long, confusing, and overlaps with the appliances they're selling. Scrolling down, on the left hand side, there is contact information that is easy to miss because it's covered up by other information or is covering additional information.  </p>
            <p> At the bottom of the home page is a Christmas collage/animation. There's a waving Santa, with Frosty the Snowman, and flashing house lights. There's also a glistening Christmas tree and snow falling. The collage goes on to the wise men, Santa pulling off into the air with so many more animations. This threw me off, as this seems complicated to make, yet the rest of the website is… a tragedy. Looking at the code, I did not realize how good I had it with the previous two websites. I could not find any columns, but there was so much to the code I could have missed it. I think a lot of the code was confusing because of the layout, and it is all the stuff we have learned in CS-202, but the website does not look good. Overall, the only nice thing about this website is the Christmas animation; however, I'm not sure if that was uploaded recently or if it is a permanent addition.  </p>
