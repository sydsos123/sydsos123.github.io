    Arkansas has A LOT going on. I found their website to be very overstimulating. Between the frequent photo changes and the typing search bar, it kind of gave me a headache. I think the pictures changed so fast to cover up that they were highly pixelated and probably not photos of Arkansas residents. I found the half screen to be much more useful and visually appealing than the full screen. It allowed you to scroll through websites easily and was much easier for navigation purposes. Once in half screen, the pictures were no longer pixelated either. I think the text color and fonts they used for their headings did not stand out and could be easily missed; however, they still had better photos than Alaska. I think Arkansas is a prime example of doing too much because you have nothing going on. Their website was super overwhelming to me and it made it harder to navigate for me. I think this website was made more for mobile purposes.
