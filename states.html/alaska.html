    <h1>Alaska</h1>

    Talk about let downs. I was extremely disappointed in this website as Alaska is one of the most beautiful states ever! This website has mid 2000s vibes. If it were pink, I'd feel like I was 10 again, about to play some mini-games on the Barbie website. I did not like the pictures they chose as they have SO MANY other gorgeous pictures to use. I could have easily taken that mountain photo with my iPhone. That being said, since the home screen is pretty simple, at least in terms of the other websites, the home page was easy to navigate. I like how they had the search bar available at all times, even in half screen; though, the half screen cut off part of the right side of the page. The colors do not stand out to be, but I think that would give them the perfect opportunity to have some amazing photos. If Kansas has nice photos, Alaska should be blowing them out of the water. Overall, compared to the other websites, Alaska was a huge let down.
