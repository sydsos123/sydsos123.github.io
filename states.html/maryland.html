    <h1> Maryland</h1>
    
    <p> 
   Maryland's website was just okay. They get knocked down to the half screen. I did not like the colors or their layout. The red background mixed with the white font made the text hard to read. The red was the same color in their state symbol, which made it hard to see the symbol in the upper left hand corner. The home page was underwhelming and did not help with navigation at all. Their menu had a lot more to offer with navigation. They also had a search bar available in both half and full screen. In full screen, I really liked the options they had, as well as the background videos they used. The menu was no longer a hamburger button, but just a list. Maryland's website was simple and to the point, which I really liked; however, the half screen was not great.
