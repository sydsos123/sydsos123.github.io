    <p>
    I really liked Maine's website! It was visually appealing and worked in both half and full screen. The website was pretty much exactly the same in half and full screen. I liked the colors and the photos they used, they all complimented each other and flowed well. It was easy to scroll through and pretty informative. I liked how the website was not trying to overwhelm you with information, but it gave you enough information to find the correct pages to go to. I also thought the map feature was pretty cute. The linked pages in the menu had the same vibes as the homescreen and were equally as helpful. I did not like that the search bar was not available at all times and if you wanted to use it, you had to go back to the home page. Overall, I liked the website's layout, design, and that it functioned well in both half and full screen.
