        Kansas surprised me as the website was more put together than I thought it was going to be. I think because it seems like a fly-over state to me, I was not expecting the website to be good. I surprisingly liked the orange details and its cover photo. I liked that the 'Discover More' button actually worked and took you to a page with all the boards listed. It was fairly easy to get back to the homepage. The homepage was super helpful for navigation. I liked this because it did not make the menu/navigation bar overwhelming, but you were still able to click on stuff while exploring the homepage. While I liked the homepage, I could see someone who came there for something specific, overwhelmed with all the options to pick from. I did not like that the search bar was not available in the half screen.
